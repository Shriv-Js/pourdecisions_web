                                                        quickly
                                                        became
                                                        in love with the French art de vivre, the food and of course the
                                                        wine. Ilya always
                                                        wanted to
                                                        promote and bring some of this Provençal taste with him wherever
                                                        he went. Having
                                                        studied
                                                        business and marketing in London, he felt the time has come to

                                                        and develop a business that would encompass his passion for wine
                                                        and branding. Ilya
                                                        moved to
                                                        Miami and immediately identified the growing need for
